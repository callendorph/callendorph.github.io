I studied electrical engineering at Caltech. I spent most of my time there in the sub-basement of Moore with a cadre of other passionate undergrads and grad students.

I've worked in startups for the last 10+ years designing, building, debugging, and testing high performance embedded systems including:

1.  Custom mono- and stereo-vision systems including optics, imagers, and DSP/FPGAs.
2.  Motor controls for [heliostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliostat)
3.  Robotic control systems for [fruit harvesting systems](https://advanced.farm/).
4.  Telemetry systems for fleet management and monitoring applications.

## Values

1.  __Communication__ - In a group of `N` people, there are `N!` vectors of communication. Your voice is only `N-1` of those vectors. Unless `N=1`, you are not the majority contributor.
2.  __Diligence__ - Correctness is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The goal is what matters.
3.  __Fullfillment__ - The feeling of satisfaction when accomplishing a goal and improving others lives in the process.
